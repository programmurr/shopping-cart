# Shopping Cart

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/shopping-cart)

*"You will make a Shopping Cart application in React. It should have at least two routes to give you a chance to make use of your newly acquired react-router-dom skills."*

## Requirements:
1. At least two pages - a home page and a shop page (which includes the shopping cart)
2. Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes
3. On the shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. Have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however don't implement this logic)
4. Build individual card items for each of the products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items he or she wants to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. Display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button
5. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust
6. Style the application
